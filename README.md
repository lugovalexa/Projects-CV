# Projects-CV
## Portfolio of projects to accompany my CV

Hello ! This repository contains 7 Python projects. It was created to streghten my CV and illustrate my skills in Python and different research areas.

**1. Project "Electricity consumption during steel processing"** 

Task: 
In order to optimize production costs, a metallurgical plant decided to reduce electricity consumption at the stage of steel processing. 
The goal is to build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel.

**2. Project "Gold Recovery"**

Task: 
Create a prototype machine learning model for Zifra, a company that develops solutions for efficient operation of industrial enterprises.
The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. Data on extraction and cleaning parameters is available.
The model is intended to help optimize production so as not to launch potentially unprofitable enterprise.

**3. Project "Wikishop"**

Task:
Online store "Wikishop" launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities.
That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others.
The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation.
At disposal there is a dataset with markup on the toxicity of edits.

**4. Project "Distribution of public messages"**

Task:
Study the possibility of using the Multi-Armed Bandit and Epsilon-Greedy algoritms instead of A/B testing for optimisation of public messages distribution campaigns.
Compare the algorithms efficiency on artificial data.

**5. Project "Sales revenue forecast"**

Task:
Build a model to predict sales revenue based on ad impressions (or expenditure) and other factors.
Evaluate the contribution of each advertising channel to sales revenue. 
Calculate total ROAS and weekly ROAS (return on advertising investment) and iROAS (return on incremental investment, based on current spending). 
Calculate iROAS by increasing current ad spend by 1%.

**6. Project "Stress detection"**

Task:
Detect moments of pre-stress, stress, post-stress and no-stress from biological signals data coming from wearables "Empatica E4".
Data as well as the part of code dedicated to stress analysis is not available for this project due to data non-disclosure agreement–ë

**7. Project "Twitter data"**

Task:
Retrieve tweets on "academic mental health" topic from 4 English-speaking countries (UK, USA, South Africa, Australia) for 5 years.
Conduct exploratory, sentiment and topic analyses.
Consider differences between countries and changes attributable to the pandemic of covid-19. 

**8. Project "Transport mode choice"**

Task:
Define factors of public transport use frequency by working inhabitants of Grenoble. 
Conduct literature review, descriptive, statistical and econometric (model of logit) analysis. 

**9. Projet "TS-MARS marketing"**

Task: 
Create a user-friendly code to analyze synergistic and antagonistic effects of different marketing campaigns on sales. 
Include data pre-processing, statistical tests. 
Use MARS-TS model and compare its performance to alternative methods. 
Build visualizations for synergy.
